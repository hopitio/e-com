        * Price list above is included 10% VAT<br>
        * Maximum weight or conversion weight is 100 kg <br>
        * Oversize goods: Refer section 2.1<br>
        <h4>2. Additional Information</h4>
        2.1. Oversize goods<br>
        Weight of Oversize goods would be calculated by this formula: (called conversion weight)<br>
        <br>
        Express or premium service:<br>
        Conversion weight (kg) = (LxWxH) / 3000<br>
        (units: cm)<br>
        <br>
       Standard service:<br>
        Conversion weight (kg) = (LxWxH) / 6000<br>
       (units: cm)<br>
        <br>
        * If the conversion weight is greater than the actual weight of goods, it would be used to calculated shipping fees<br>
        Ex: Product A weighing 1 kg. Its dimension is 30cm x 50cm x 2cm. Then its conversion weight is (30x50x6) / 6000 = 1.5 kg. Because A’s conversion weight is greater than its actual weight, 1.5 kg will be used to calculated the shipping fee of standard service.<br>
        2.2. Scope of delivery service<br>
        Sfriendly gladly announces that we are able to deliver to Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh city and 63 other provinces within Vietnam (exclude islands. If you need to delivery to these areas, please contact us for assistant) Shipping fee is refered to section 1.<br>
